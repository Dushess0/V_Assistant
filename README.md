My first application. It's include media player, timer, stopwatch. It also can draw on screen and add an application on screen for quick access. C#+WinForms = POWER



Shortcuts:
ALT+X media player
ALT+D clear screen
ALT+A eraser
ALT+Q pallete for on-screen brush
ALT+E toggle on-screen drawing

If you want to try it just download folder with name "Vass" and run exe.
